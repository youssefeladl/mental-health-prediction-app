# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction App

A full-stack machine learning project for **predicting the risk of mental health issues** based on user input.  
Built with **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** models, presented through a clean **Streamlit web interface**, and backed by a deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline.
